								| After Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo., by police officer Darren Wilson, pointed questions arose about police shootings: How often do they happen? Who are the victims? What happens to the officers? Those questions couldn’t be answered because government data was incomplete. So, a team of reporters, researchers and editors at The Washington Post spent the past year building a comprehensive database of the country’s fatal shootings by police officers in the line of duty. “We needed to do this because it wasn’t being done well,” said Post managing editor Cameron Barr. “People in a democratic society have a right to know the results of the state’s use of force in the enforcement of law.”

								li Four
							p As of December 16, the database had more than 900 entries with more than a dozen details about each killing — including the race of the person who was killed, the circumstances of the shooting, and whether the person was armed.

							p From this large-scale undertaking came stories that drove an informed conversation about police shootings and led to critical policy reforms: Our reporters found that nearly a quarter of the dead were people experiencing a mental health crisis, making clear the need for additional police training.
							p 
								| Our reporters also found dozens of shootings captured on police body cameras. Many departments refused to make the footage public, despite promises of greater transparency.Another major finding, reported on the first anniversary of the Michael Brown shooting, was that unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to die by police gunfire.These significant findings caught the attention of law enforcement leaders across the country. Recently, in part as a result of our work, the FBI has committed to change the way it tracks and compiles data surrounding these incidents. Investigation: Police shootings

								| Shootings by police per month in 2015 Shooting deaths per million residents, by state So far this year, there have been… www.washingtonpost.com How did this start? Wesley Lowery, national reporter After the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, as a reporter on the ground very early on, I had a lot of conversations with editors where they were asking: What kind of national context can we put this in? What kind of information is available about police shootings, and how many times this has happened? We had activists telling us that this is happens all the time, that black men are being executed in the street, especially unarmed black men. Meanwhile, we had the police union in St. Louis saying that this never happens.

							p
								| How did you determine what the bounds of the database were? Julie Tate and Jennifer Jenkins, news researchers We arrived at the universe of all people being shot by police because it was a clean universe; when someone is shot and killed by a police officer there’s no confusion about what the cause of death was.

											p I did a quick research and found that in Germany this number is 46. Even if we take into account the differences in population it would still put you up on top by 5x more. Except that I got my facts wrong. 46 is the number of shots that were fired at people by the police. Killed were only 7.
